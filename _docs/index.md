## About Us

Parallel is currently a two man operation, with [Ben Goldhaber]() and [Jacob Lagerros]() building the social and technical infrastructure needed for accurate predictions on decision relevant questions in the science and technology space.

----

This started as a relatively simple project to list AI technology questions on prediction markets. However, as often happens when you start on a 'simple' project, we began to realize how much was missing to do forecasting well.

Necessary Infrastructure:

- Operationalizations: How do you generate good forecastable questions that are tied to real world events and contain a strong 'signal' of what is going to happen?
- Legal: What's the right structure to reward forecasters financially for their time and contributions?
- Mechanism Design: 
- Scaling: Getting 10 people to share their ideas and models on a forecast is relatively easy - how do you get 1000 people?


## Backers

This project would not be possible without the support of [BERI](http://existence.org).
